Make a command to set the SessionTrackerEnabler to true/false whether it's enabled or disabled.
Also make command to set target of session time tracker, write to db.
Make sure to set the enabled session tracker in ready() in the session_tracker's mod.rs to whatever value is read from the db later.

Perhaps periodically open and close the db to make use of cached prepared db statements in the time tracker

Might want to create separate threads to run each remove and add role request. This way, it gets done faster





Make sure to make the command to:
    set other user's birthdays (privileged: true). Extract function from other command to reuse code
    add, get, and remove server role used for bday
    add, get, and remove bdays. 

implement cooldown for birthday commands (called buckets in serenity)
